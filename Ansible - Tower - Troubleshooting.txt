=== UNABLE TO LOGIN TO TOWER VIA HTTP ===

Access to Tower is intentionally restricted through a secure protocol (HTTPS).

In cases where your configuration is set up to run a Tower node behind a load balancer or proxy as "HTTP only", and you only want to access it without SSL (for troubleshooting, for example), change:
# /etc/tower/conf.d/custom.py
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = False
CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = False

Changing these settings to False will allow Tower to manage cookies and login sessions when using the HTTP protocol.
This must be done on every node of a cluster installation to properly take effect.

# Apply changes:
ansible-tower-service restart


=== PROBLEMS RUNNING A PLAYBOOK ===

Are you authenticating with the user currently running the commands? 
If not, check how the username has been setup or pass the --user=username or -u username commands to specify a user.

Is your YAML file correctly indented?
You may need to line up your whitespace correctly.
You can use yamlint to check your playbook.


=== PLAYBOOKS ARENâ€™T SHOWING UP IN THE "JOB TEMPLATE" DROP-DOWN ===
Make sure that the playbook is valid YML and can be parsed by Ansible.
Make sure the permissions and ownership of the project path (/var/lib/awx/projects) is set up so that the "awx" system user can view the files.
Change the ownership:
chown awx -R /var/lib/awx/projects/
