/etc/ansible/hosts
ansible -i <FILENAME>
In ansible.cfg

INVENTORY file may contain:
- hosts
- patterns
- groups
- variables

-------------

Don't add VARIABLES directly in INVENTORY files,
put them (in YAML files) inside DIRECTORIES:

group_vars		(Group hosts together)
host_vars		(Singe host per file)

^^ In the same directory as INVENTORY file

-------------

To reference a VARIABLES in CLI:
eg of A variable named: opt_dir

*In this file:
/etc/ansible/inventory/node1.local.vm
	opt_dir: /opt

*CLI:
ansible node1.local.vm -i inventory -a "ls -l {{opt_dir}}"

-------------

## Dynamic INVENTORY:
1. Must respond to:
--list
--host [HOSTNAME]

2. Must return JSON formated output.
