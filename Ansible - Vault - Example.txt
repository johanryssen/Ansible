## Generate new secret with:
$ ansible-vault encrypt_string

## Playbook:
---
- name: subscribe
  hosts: rhel
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Read passwd var
	  include_vars:
	    file: rhel_cred.yml
	
    - name: Register and auto-subscribe to available content.
      redhat_subscription:
        state: present
        username: <CHANGE_TO_RHN_USERNAME>
        password: "{{ user_password | password_hash('sha512') }}"
        auto_attach: true


...

You can also set ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE environment variable,
e.g. ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE=~/.vault_pass.txt
and Ansible will automatically search for the password in that file.
This is something you may wish to do if using Ansible from a continuous integration system like Jenkins.
